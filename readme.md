# jspinch
Write better javascript with jspinch. jspinch is a simple [JSHint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/) and [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com) wrapper that lets developers track the JavaScript code quality of projects.
## Motivation
*JavaScript linters should love all your code.*

JavaScript projects start small. As they grow, it becomes important to enforce good style and convention. jspinch uses JSHint or JSLint to create reports detailing errors in JavaScript files.

It empowers developers to answer the question, "How much does JSHint (or JSLint) love my code?"

jspinch provides an extensible reporter interface. It wants to be part of a continuious integration server or your build process.
