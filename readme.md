# jspinch
Write better javascript with jspinch. jspinch is a [JSHint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/) wrapper that lets developers track JavaScript code quality of projects by measuring the number of JSHint errors.
## Motivation
*JSHint should love all your code.*

JavaScript projects start small. As they grow, it becomes important to enforce good style and convention with a linting tool like JSHint or JSLint. jspinch builds on top of JSHint to collect simple metrics about all the JavaScript in your project. 

It empowers developers to answer the question, "How much does JSHint like my code?"

jspinch provides an extensible reporter interface. It wants to be part of a continuious integration server to track code quality over time.
## Installation
TBD
## Usage
There are two ways to run jspinch. You can run it from the command line, or use it directly in node.js.
### CLI
